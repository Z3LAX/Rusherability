# Editing
  
  If you have tested a client or a mod then please message me on discord, do not try to edit the repo as I won't add it. Before a mod or client is added to the list, I need verification of the client working with rusherhack. 
  

 # Support
If you have any issues or if there is an error with the list please message me on discord @ `toast#5673`
